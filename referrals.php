    <div class="container about referral"><h1>Referral system</h1><div class="main-image"></div><div class="text-container"><p>You may have already heard that many large platforms create referral systems to attract new users to a team of like-minded people. This is beneficial for both parties: the site gets the opportunity to advertise among a larger number of people, as well as the opportunity to attract a new audience from trusted persons, that is, you — our clients, and you get a good reward for inviting new project participants.</p><h2>How does it work?</h2><p>The referral system on our exchange is divided into three stages: <br><br> A: a group of people who registered directly with your link; B: friends of your referrals, who, in turn, were invited by category “A” referrals and registered by their referral code; C: registered users on a referral link of a referral from category “B” </p><h2>Who are referrals and why are they needed?</h2><p>A referral is a partner program participant who has registered on the recommendation of another participant. A referral is also a full-fledged user of the <?=getSettings('name', $db);?> Exchange, without any restrictions. The person who brought the new member to the project will receive a commission (referral). Accordingly, the more people click on the link, the more passive earnings the referrer will have</p><h2>What kind of reward awaits you?</h2><p>As we mentioned above, the updated referral system includes as many as three stages of referrals, respectively, the rewards will also vary for you depending on your category. For category A referrals you get 50% of the commission, category B referrals will bring you 10%, and for category C you will get 2.5% of the commission. <br><br> For each referral you will receive your percentage, but this percentage will depend on the referral category: A, B or C. <br><br> At the moment, the referral system and the ability to create an unlimited number of referral codes are only available to premium users. <br><br> <?=getSettings('name', $db);?> referral program packs these key features: <br><br> · No referral limits - You can refer as many friends as possible; you and your friends will each get refferal bonus in BTC equivalent after they complete their verification. <br><br> · Anyone can participate - Available for all eligible Trading users, no BTC/ETH/BCH staking required to refer friends. <br><br> · Bonus credited instantly - Your friends can use their sign-up bonus immediately after they passing verification. <br><br> · Get rewards for your friends deposit - For each new friend you will receive 0.01% (in BTC) of the sum of all his deposits. </p></div></div>
